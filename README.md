# Course Material for the UC Berkeley Master's in Data Science Program's Python Bridge Course.

This course was designed and created by Paul Laskowski, Kay Ashaolu, and Bill Chambers in the Summer and Fall of 2015.

This course is being taught during the Winter and Spring of 2016 and is listed as Info-W18. More information can be found on the [course page](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/bridge-course/).

> Python for Data Science is a 15-week course for applicants who lack the required programming competency. These students will be conditionally admitted to the MIDS program and are expected to successfully complete the bridge course prior to beginning MIDS coursework.

> This course is structured the same as our MIDS courses, preparing you for the program’s learning experience as well as the programming skills necessary to succeed in the rest of the MIDS courses. The workload for this course is about equal to a regular MIDS course and consists of weekly live classes and online asynchronous, self-paced coursework.
